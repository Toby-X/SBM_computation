# function for training the model with data
# N: number of samples
# b: power for rho, i.e., the connection probability
# K: community number
# beta: power parameter for imbalance (heterogeneity) of the community sizes
# M: parameter of the connection probability
# return: selected metrics, now is Accuracy, Macro-F1, Micro-F1, NMI, ARI
